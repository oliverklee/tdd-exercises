This is a starter repository for a project with PHPUnit.


## Installation


### PHP

#### Local PHP

You will need a local PHP installation with Composer (which is the
preferred way).

#### Vagrant

Instead, you can also use Vagrant to run on a PHP 7 box.
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd tdd-seed/
```


### Composer packages

Run `composer install` to install the required Composer packages.
